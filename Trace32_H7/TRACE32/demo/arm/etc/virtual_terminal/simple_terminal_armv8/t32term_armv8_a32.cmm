; @Title: Example for using the 'virtual terminal' via DCC for ARMv8 AArch32
; @Description:
; Example for using the 'virtual terminal' via the Debug Communication Channel
; (DCC) for ARMV8 AArch32 ARM mode
; The example assumes RAM at address 2e008000.
; After executing this script you need to run the loaded example program ('Go')
; It outputs 'Hello world!' in the TERM window.
; When you enter three characters of any type it outputs 'Hello world!' again.
;
; See the target manual of the arm debugger (debugger_arm.pdf) for more details
; about the 'virtual terminal'.
;
; The debugger is expected to be in 'UP' state, therefore a target specific
; start-up script probably similar to the following one for the simulator will
; be needed to run first.
